## Getting Started

Start by installing the client using your preferred package manager, below is an example of Yarn.

```bash
yarn add @locktech/docker-client
```

## Contributing

This repository acts as a template for generating, building, and publishing a client for the Docker Engine API. This process is triggered when [a new release is created](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository#creating-a-release), which will use [the configured specification](./.github/workflows/release.yml) as a reference for generation. After being generated, the built package is published to the npm registry - versioned using the release's `tag`.

```YAML
name: CI ‚Äî Generate and Release

env:
  # Update the following to change the reference used for generating the client.
  DOCKER_ENGINE_API: https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.41.yaml

...
```

### Building Manually

The following steps will build the client locally, and is the same set of steps used by the repository's CI runner.

1. `git clone https://github.com/LockTech/docker-client-ts.git`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run generate https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/vX.XX.yaml`
   - Generate a client using the given specification as a reference.
   - You can get the published version via [the `release` workflow](./.github/workflows/release.yml).
4. `npm run build`
